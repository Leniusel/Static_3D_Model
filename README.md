# Static_3D_Model
Build a static 3D model in Blender.

For my project, I created a 3D model of my teapot on a tray.

I used two cylinders as the base of the teapot and its handle. The first cylinder had multiple subdivisions, so I could scale the edges and faces to make the overall round base shape. I did attempt to make the nozzle extrude from the cylinder base, but I had a hard time selecting the correct edges. The nozzle ended up with a rugged appearance. When I realized this, I decided to model the curvy details with a separate primitive object instead. The second cylinder was used to model the teapot handle. The edges and faces were rotated to make the handle curl. I scaled its edges and faces to match the reference picture. The icosphere was added, translated, and scaled to the center to make the knob on the teapot's cap. The circle was used to make the halo above the teapot. I did merge these objects into one and renamed them 'TeaPot' and smoothed the edges out. The plane object was used to make the tray. I added subdivisions to the sides and corners so I could extrude them upward, giving the tray depth. 

The TeaPot object has a blue glass material applied to it. Light can shine through it slightly. The tray has greyish wave textures. I wanted to make it look like this: https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/white-old-tree-near-the-sea-curves-and-swirls-on-rustic-timber-gm803612984-130307355

Sunlight was added. I used blender's in-built sunrise lighting environment to make it look nice in the render.

I do think that more details could be added to the teapot. I would make the teapot hollow, reduce its thickness, and add water to the teapot. I think grease pencil could be used to make details like flowers and butterflies on the teapot. I would also modifiy the glass material so it would be less cloudy.
